# [Download the pack now!](https://github.com/RiskiVR/JSB_HD_Music_Pack/releases/latest/download/JSB.HD.Music.Pack.zip)
  
Welcome to the JS&B HD Music Pack! This pack replaces most audio files for the game's levels.
Not every song needed a replacement, however most of them did.
This project was really painful to figure out, as every level is an Asset Bundle.
<br>

Check the list below to see which tracks were replaced & remastered!

> [!NOTE]
> Track selection preview audio is not affected
